# Integration Test Summary

## Created Integration Tests

### T029: Multi-Adapter Installation (`test_multi_adapter.sh`)
- **Purpose**: Test installing multiple adapters without conflicts
- **Key Features**:
  - Install spec-kit, aider, and bmad mock adapters
  - Verify automatic prefixing prevents conflicts
  - Check each adapter has its own manifest
  - Verify all adapters can coexist
  - Test selective removal doesn't affect other adapters

### T030: Custom Paths Configuration (`test_custom_paths.sh`)
- **Purpose**: Full test with non-standard paths
- **Key Features**:
  - Set custom SCRIPTS_PATH, SPECS_PATH, MEMORY_PATH
  - Install adapter and verify path rewriting
  - Check that installed files use the custom paths
  - Verify manifest tracks original and custom paths
  - Test removal with custom paths

### T031: Update Workflow (`test_update_workflow.sh`)
- **Purpose**: Test full update cycle with customizations
- **Key Features**:
  - Install initial adapter version (v1.0)
  - Customize some files (plan.md, config.yml)
  - Simulate upstream changes (v2.0 with new features)
  - Run update and verify customizations preserved
  - Check that non-customized files were updated
  - Verify manifest tracks the update

### T032: Complete Removal (`test_removal_complete.sh`)
- **Purpose**: Verify complete cleanup after removal
- **Key Features**:
  - Install comprehensive adapter with all file types
  - Track initial state before and after installation
  - Add custom files that should not be removed
  - Remove adapter and verify complete cleanup
  - Check custom files are preserved
  - Verify empty directories are cleaned up
  - Test multiple install/remove cycles

## Test Framework Features

Each test includes:
- **Shell script with proper shebang** (`#!/bin/bash`)
- **Library sourcing** from project root
- **Test environment setup** with `mktemp` temporary directories
- **Cleanup trap** to remove test directories
- **Colored output** for pass/fail results
- **Proper exit codes** (0 for success, 1 for failure)
- **Executable permissions** (`chmod +x`)

## Test Assertion Pattern

```bash
assert_test() {
    local test_description="$1"
    local condition="$2"

    if eval "$condition"; then
        echo -e "${GREEN}✓ PASS:${NC} $test_description"
        ((TESTS_PASSED++))
        return 0
    else
        echo -e "${RED}✗ FAIL:${NC} $test_description"
        ((TESTS_FAILED++))
        return 1
    fi
}
```

## Running Tests

Individual test execution:
```bash
./tests/integration/test_multi_adapter.sh
./tests/integration/test_custom_paths.sh
./tests/integration/test_update_workflow.sh
./tests/integration/test_removal_complete.sh
```

All integration tests:
```bash
./tests/run-tests.sh integration
```

## Technical Notes

- Tests use mock adapters with realistic file structures
- Temporary test environments prevent pollution of main project
- Library sourcing pattern handles dependencies correctly
- Tests verify both positive and negative cases
- Manifest tracking ensures complete installation/removal
- Path rewriting tests ensure adapter portability
