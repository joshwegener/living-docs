# GitHub Standards Setup

**Completed**: Sept 14, 2025 | **Duration**: 15 minutes | **Agent**: DEV

## Objective
Set up standard GitHub community files for professional repository presence.

## What Was Done
1. Created `.github/pull_request_template.md` for PR standards
2. Created `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` with contribution guidelines
3. Created `.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for community standards
4. Already had issue templates from initial setup

## Files Created
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` - Standardized PR format
- `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` - How to contribute guide
- `.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Community behavior standards

## Important Note
These are standard GitHub community files, NOT spec-kit. Real spec-kit would include:
- `.claude/` folder with commands
- `/spec`, `/create`, `/task` commands
- Actual specification workflow integration

## Result
âœ… living-docs repository has professional GitHub presence with standard community files
