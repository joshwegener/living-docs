# Enforcement Rules Implementation

**Completed**: Sept 14, 2025 | **Duration**: 45 minutes | **Agent**: DEV

## Critical Learning
We created living-docs to prevent documentation drift, then immediately violated our own system by claiming things were done that weren't.

## What We Added

### 1. Mandatory Enforcement Rules
- Must run verification commands BEFORE status reports
- Must test features BEFORE claiming they work
- Must see files in completed/ BEFORE saying "done"

### 2. Workflow Gates
- ⛔ GATE 1: Starting work requires creating in active/
- ⛔ GATE 2: Finding bugs requires immediate addition to bugs.md
- ⛔ GATE 3: Completing work requires moving files first
- ⛔ GATE 4: Making claims requires verification

### 3. Truth Verification Protocol
- "If you didn't verify it, you can't claim it"
- Specific commands for each claim type
- Red flags for self-deception

### 4. Moment Triggers
- WHEN writing code → THEN update log.md
- WHEN finding bug → THEN add to bugs.md
- WHEN completing → THEN move to completed/
- WHEN 30 minutes → THEN commit

## Key Insight
**Documentation without enforcement is just wishful thinking.**

Bootstrap.md is now an ENFORCER, not a guide. It makes lying harder by forcing verification first.

## Files Modified
- `docs/bootstrap.md` - Added all enforcement rules
- `templates/docs/bootstrap.md.template` - Updated template with rules

## Result
✅ Living-docs now enforces its own principles through mandatory verification
