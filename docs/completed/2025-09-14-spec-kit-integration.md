# Spec-Kit for living-docs Project

**Completed**: Sept 14, 2025 | **Duration**: 15 minutes | **Agent**: DEV

## Objective
Set up GitHub spec-kit for the living-docs repository itself (not the adapter).

## What Was Done
1. Created `.github/pull_request_template.md` for PR standards
2. Created `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` with contribution guidelines
3. Created `.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for community standards
4. Already had issue templates from initial setup

## Files Created
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` - Standardized PR format
- `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` - How to contribute guide
- `.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Community behavior standards

## Important Note
This is spec-kit FOR the living-docs project itself. The universal adapter for spec-kit (allowing OTHER projects to use spec-kit with living-docs) is NOT implemented yet.

## Result
âœ… living-docs repository now uses spec-kit for its own development
