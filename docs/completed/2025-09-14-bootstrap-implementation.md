# Bootstrap.md Implementation

**Completed**: Sept 14, 2025 | **Duration**: 30 minutes | **Agent**: DEV

## Objective
Implement bootstrap.md to separate AI instructions from project data for cleaner architecture.

## What Was Done
1. Created `bootstrap.md` file containing all AI instructions
2. Updated all templates to reference bootstrap.md instead of current.md
3. Modified wizard.sh to automatically create bootstrap.md
4. Removed status reporting instructions from current.md
5. Established clean chain: CLAUDE.md → bootstrap.md → current.md

## Key Changes
- `templates/docs/bootstrap.md.template` - New template for AI instructions
- `docs/bootstrap.md` - Living-docs own bootstrap file
- All CLAUDE.md/AI.md/PROJECT.md templates updated to reference bootstrap.md
- `current.md` now pure project data (no instructions)

## Benefits
- Zero friction: Users never edit CLAUDE.md or bootstrap.md
- Clean separation of concerns (instructions vs data)
- current.md stays human-readable dashboard
- Bootstrap.md is versionable and updateable

## Result
✅ Successfully implemented cleaner architecture with proper separation of concerns
