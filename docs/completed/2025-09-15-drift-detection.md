# Drift Detection System Implementation

**Status**: âœ… Complete
**Date**: September 15, 2025
**Agent**: DEV

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive documentation drift detection and auto-fix system with pre-commit hooks.

## What Was Built

### 1. check-drift.sh Script
- Detects orphaned files not linked in current.md
- Finds broken links in documentation
- Updates bug/idea counts automatically
- **Auto-fix by default** with --dry-run option
- Smart categorization based on file paths

### 2. Pre-commit Hook
- Runs drift check before every commit
- Auto-adds fixes to current commit
- Warns about undocumented code changes
- Non-blocking to maintain velocity

### 3. Installation Script
- scripts/install-hooks.sh for easy setup
- Configures git to use .githooks/

## Key Features
- **Zero tolerance** for documentation drift
- **Self-healing** documentation
- **Automated enforcement** via git hooks
- **Smart categorization** with "UNCATEGORIZED" section

## Lessons Learned
- Even while building anti-drift tools, we created drift
- Auto-fix needs careful categorization logic
- The tool exposed 34 orphaned files in our own repo

## Files Created
- scripts/check-drift.sh
- scripts/install-hooks.sh
- .githooks/pre-commit
- specs/drift-detection.md

## Next Steps
- Improve categorization intelligence
- Add AI-powered description generation
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline

*This system ensures documentation drift literally cannot enter the repository.*
