# Quick Bug Tracker

*One-liner bug capture - promote to docs/issues/ when investigation needed*

## ðŸ”´ Critical
- [ ] Wizard.sh needs error handling for missing template files
- [ ] Paths with spaces break sed commands in scripts

## ðŸŸ¡ High Priority

- [ ] Wizard should validate DOCS_PATH before creating structure
- [ ] Adapter version mismatch: local versions (e.g., 2.0.0) don't match GitHub tags (e.g., v0.0.47) â†’ [docs/issues/adapter-version-mismatch.md](../issues/adapter-version-mismatch.md)
- [ ] check-drift.sh incorrectly adds orphaned spec files as top-level entries instead of under their parent specs

## ðŸŸ¢ Normal
- [ ] Better error messages when run outside project directory
