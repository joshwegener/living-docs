# Compliance Violations Found

**Date**: 2025-09-17
**Reviewer**: AI Review (Manual)
**Result**: FAIL ❌

## Critical Violations

### 1. TDD_TESTS_FIRST Violation
- **Issue**: No `plan.md` file exists
- **Impact**: Implementation started without planning phase
- **Required**: Create plan.md with implementation strategy

### 2. MISSING_TASKS_MD Violation
- **Issue**: No `tasks.md` file exists
- **Impact**: No task tracking, can't verify TDD phases
- **Required**: Create tasks.md with proper phase structure

### 3. MISSING_CORE_IMPLEMENTATION
Despite having implementation files, the spec's core requirements are NOT met:

#### Missing Primary Feature (FR-015 to FR-023)
- [ ] `.claude/agents/compliance-reviewer.md` - NOT CREATED
- [ ] `/review` command integration - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- [ ] Isolated context mechanism - NOT BUILT
- [ ] Binary PASS/FAIL response - NOT WORKING
- [ ] Audit trail functionality - NOT PRESENT

#### What Was Built Instead
- ✓ `scripts/fresh-context-review.sh` - Basic script (fallback only)
- ✓ `scripts/compliance/` - Script-based checking
- ✓ Rule files in `docs/rules/` - Partial implementation

## The Core Problem
**A script says "COMPLIANCE CHECK PASSED" when the main feature isn't even built!**

This is EXACTLY why we need an AI reviewer:
1. Script can't know if `.claude/agents/` exists
2. Script can't verify if TDD phases were followed
3. Script can't understand if the implementation matches the spec
4. Script passed despite missing 80% of requirements

## Remediation Required

### Immediate Actions
1. Create `plan.md` with proper implementation strategy
2. Create `tasks.md` with TDD phases:
   - Phase 1: Tests & Validation
   - Phase 2: Core Implementation
   - Phase 3: Integration
3. Build the ACTUAL review agent (not just scripts)
4. Test agent on THIS violation as proof it works

### Why This Matters
We're building a compliance system that doesn't comply with itself. The script gives false confidence while the actual feature is missing.
