# Feature Specification: System Consistency Fixes

**Feature Branch**: `001-system-consistency-fixes`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "System Consistency Fixes: Create config file, reorganize structure, archive old work, and use spec-kit workflow"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Extract: config creation, structure reorganization, archiving, workflow adoption
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: development team, AI agents, users
   ’ Actions: create config, move files, archive old work, update workflow
   ’ Data: configuration settings, documentation files, completed work
   ’ Constraints: maintain backwards compatibility, preserve existing data
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ No major ambiguities - requirements are clear from technical context
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: team member sets up living-docs properly
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement addresses a specific consistency issue
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Configuration file, documentation structure, archived work
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ All requirements are testable and implementation-agnostic
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A development team member installs living-docs in their project and expects a consistent, well-organized documentation system that follows the framework's own conventions and provides clear guidance on using installed specification frameworks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh project with living-docs installed, **When** team member runs the wizard, **Then** a configuration file is created tracking installation details
2. **Given** living-docs is installed with spec-kit, **When** team member reads documentation, **Then** they understand how to use spec-kit commands for creating specifications
3. **Given** a project with 6+ months of completed work, **When** team member reviews recent activity, **Then** they see only relevant recent work without historical noise
4. **Given** documentation exists in the configured path, **When** team member looks for specifications, **Then** all specs are consistently located in the same organized structure

### Edge Cases
- What happens when configuration file is corrupted or missing?
- How does system handle migration of existing inconsistent structure?
- What occurs when archived work needs to be referenced?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST create and maintain a configuration file tracking installation state, version, and installed frameworks
- **FR-002**: System MUST organize all specifications in a consistent location within the configured documentation path
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically archive completed work older than 30 days to reduce cognitive load
- **FR-004**: System MUST update AI assistant instructions to reference installed specification framework commands
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain backwards compatibility during structure reorganization
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve all existing documentation during reorganization
- **FR-007**: Team members MUST be able to easily discover and use installed specification frameworks
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear separation between active/recent work and historical archives

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Configuration File**: Tracks installation state, version, installed frameworks, and configuration settings
- **Documentation Structure**: Organized hierarchy following consistent path conventions
- **Archived Work**: Historical completed work moved out of active context but preserved for reference
- **Specification Framework Integration**: Connection between installed frameworks and AI assistant instructions
