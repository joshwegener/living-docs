# PR Compliance Notes - Branch 007-adapter-installation

## ⚠️ Compliance Status: FAILED

This PR contains significant TDD violations that must be acknowledged:

## Violations Summary
- **4 Critical Violations** found by independent compliance review
- **~30,000 lines** of untested-first code
- **All lib/ functions** lack proper TDD foundation

## For PR Description

## ⚠️ Compliance Notice

This branch contains TDD violations that were discovered during review:

### Known Issues
1. **Tests written after implementation** - All lib/ modules were implemented before tests
2. **No RED phase demonstrated** - Tests use skip instead of failing assertions
3. **Retrospective spec creation** - Some specs created after implementation

### Technical Debt Created
- lib/adapter/*.sh - 2,000+ lines without test-first development
- lib/security/*.sh - 1,200+ lines without test-first development
- lib/validation/*.sh - 870+ lines without test-first development

### Remediation Plan
A comprehensive TDD remediation plan has been created in `docs/tdd-remediation-plan.md` with a 4-week timeline to properly retrofit tests using TDD methodology.

### Why Merge Despite Violations?
[Add your rationale here - e.g., critical functionality needed, will fix in follow-up PR, etc.]

### Follow-up Required
- [ ] Create issue for TDD remediation
- [ ] Schedule remediation sprint
- [ ] Add git hooks to prevent future violations
- [ ] Update CI to enforce TDD

### Files Documenting Violations
- docs/compliance-violations-007.md
- docs/tdd-remediation-plan.md
- specs/007-adapter-installation/tasks.md (updated with violation markers)
```

## Recommended Actions

1. **Be Transparent**: Don't hide these violations
2. **Create Issues**: File GitHub issues for each major violation
3. **Set Timeline**: Commit to fixing within 30 days
4. **Add CI Checks**: Prevent future TDD violations
5. **Learn**: Document what went wrong to prevent recurrence

## Git Hooks to Add

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
# Prevent commits without tests

# Check if implementation files added without tests
impl_files=$(git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "lib/.*\.sh$")
test_files=$(git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "tests/.*\.(bats|sh)$")

if [ -n "$impl_files" ] && [ -z "$test_files" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Implementation files added without tests"
    echo "Write tests FIRST (TDD)"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Lessons for Team

1. **Enforce TDD from start** - Don't wait until review
2. **Use git hooks** - Automate compliance checking
3. **Regular reviews** - Don't let 30k lines accumulate
4. **Be honest** - Acknowledge violations openly
5. **Fix promptly** - Technical debt compounds quickly
