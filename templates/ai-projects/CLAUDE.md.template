## Agent Behavior Rules

### Core Principles
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- NEVER create documentation unless explicitly requested
- Use the documentation system, don't recreate it

### Critical Safety Protocols
{{SAFETY_PROTOCOLS}}

### Git Discipline
- Commit every 30 minutes or when switching tasks
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Create feature branches for new work
- Tag stable versions before major changes
