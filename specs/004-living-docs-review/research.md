# Research: Security & Infrastructure Improvements

## Security Best Practices for Shell Scripts

### Decision: Implement multi-layer security approach
**Rationale**: Shell scripts executing from curl are high-risk; industry standards require verification at multiple levels
**Alternatives considered**:
- Docker containers: Rejected - adds dependency, breaks simplicity principle
- Binary distribution: Rejected - loses transparency, harder to audit
- NPM package: Rejected - adds Node.js dependency

### Implementation Approach:
1. **Checksums**: SHA256 for all releases
2. **GPG Signing**: Detached signatures for verification
3. **HTTPS Only**: Enforce TLS for all downloads
4. **Input Sanitization**: Shellcheck-compliant quoting and validation
5. **Path Validation**: Realpath canonicalization to prevent traversal

## CI/CD Infrastructure

### Decision: GitHub Actions for automation
**Rationale**: Native to GitHub, free for public repos, widely adopted
**Alternatives considered**:
- Travis CI: Rejected - less integration, requires separate account
- Jenkins: Rejected - requires self-hosting
- CircleCI: Rejected - limited free tier

### Workflow Components:
1. **Test Pipeline**: Run on every PR
2. **Security Scanning**: Shellcheck, secret scanning
3. **Release Automation**: Tag-based releases with checksums
4. **Documentation Validation**: Drift detection on every commit

## Documentation Linting

### Decision: Vale for prose linting
**Rationale**: Most flexible, supports custom rules, CLI-based
**Alternatives considered**:
- textlint: Rejected - requires Node.js
- markdownlint: Keep as secondary tool for markdown syntax
- write-good: Rejected - too opinionated

### Integration Strategy:
- Vale config in .vale.ini
- Custom style guide in .github/styles/
- Pre-commit hooks for local checking
- CI integration for PR validation

## Test Framework Enhancement

### Decision: Bats (Bash Automated Testing System)
**Rationale**: Purpose-built for bash, TAP-compliant output, active community
**Alternatives considered**:
- shunit2: Rejected - less active development
- Custom framework: Rejected - maintenance burden
- Python subprocess tests: Rejected - adds dependency

### Test Structure:
```
tests/
├── bats/           # Bats test files
├── fixtures/       # Test data
├── helpers/        # Shared test utilities
└── run-tests.sh    # Unified runner
```

## Code Coverage for Bash

### Decision: kcov for coverage reporting
**Rationale**: Works with bash, integrates with CI, generates standard reports
**Alternatives considered**:
- bashcov: Rejected - Ruby dependency
- Manual coverage: Rejected - too error-prone

## Rollback Mechanism

### Decision: Snapshot-based backup before updates
**Rationale**: Simple, reliable, no external dependencies
**Implementation**:
1. Create .living-docs.backup/ before updates
2. Include restore script
3. Automatic rollback on update failure
4. Manual rollback command available

## Progress Indicators

### Decision: Native bash progress with fallbacks
**Rationale**: No dependencies, works everywhere
**Implementation**:
- Spinner for indeterminate progress
- Percentage bar for determinate progress
- Silent mode for CI environments
- Verbose mode for debugging

## Diagram Support

### Decision: Mermaid as confirmed in spec
**Rationale**: GitHub native rendering, wide tool support
**Integration**:
- Mermaid blocks in markdown
- CLI to validate syntax
- Export to PNG/SVG for compatibility

## Performance Optimization

### Decision: Parallel execution where possible
**Rationale**: Significant speedup for multi-file operations
**Implementation**:
- GNU parallel for bulk operations (with fallback)
- Background jobs with wait for simple parallelism
- Benchmark suite for regression testing

## Prerequisites Validation

### Decision: Comprehensive pre-flight checks
**Rationale**: Better user experience, prevents mid-operation failures
**Checks**:
- Bash version >= 4.0
- Git availability and version
- Write permissions
- Network connectivity (for updates)
- Disk space

## Debug Mode Implementation

### Decision: Environment variable controlled verbosity
**Rationale**: Standard Unix pattern, easy to enable
**Features**:
- LIVING_DOCS_DEBUG=1 enables verbose output
- Trace mode for command execution
- Timestamp all operations
- Log to file option

## Accessibility Compliance

### Decision: Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines for CLI output
**Rationale**: Industry standard, tool support available
**Implementation**:
- Semantic output structure
- Screen reader friendly messages
- No color-only information
- Alternative text for diagrams
