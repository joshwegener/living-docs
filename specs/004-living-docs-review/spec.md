# Feature Specification: Security & Infrastructure Improvements

**Feature Branch**: `004-living-docs-review`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "living-docs-review-2025.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Comprehensive review document analyzed
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: security vulnerabilities, documentation drift, missing infrastructure, DX gaps
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Multiple user flows identified for different improvements
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement is testable and prioritized
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties around implementation timeline"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer installing living-docs for the first time, I want to securely install the framework with confidence that the code hasn't been tampered with, receive clear feedback during installation, and have the ability to rollback if something goes wrong.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new project without living-docs, **When** user runs the installation command, **Then** the installer verifies checksums before execution and provides progress indicators
2. **Given** an existing living-docs installation, **When** user runs update command, **Then** system creates a backup and provides rollback option if update fails
3. **Given** a project with documentation, **When** drift detection runs, **Then** all documentation inconsistencies are identified and reported
4. **Given** a pull request is created, **When** CI/CD pipeline runs, **Then** automated tests validate documentation accuracy and code quality
5. **Given** a user encounters an error, **When** they consult documentation, **Then** troubleshooting guide provides clear resolution steps

### Edge Cases
- What happens when network fails during installation?
- How does system handle corrupted downloads?
- What occurs when user has insufficient permissions?
- How are conflicting documentation versions resolved?
- What happens when rollback itself fails?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Critical Security Requirements

- **FR-005**: System MUST clean up temporary files even when errors occur
- **FR-006**: System MUST check permissions before modifying any files

#### Documentation Accuracy Requirements
- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically detect documentation drift
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate that all documented features exist and work
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure bugs.md accurately reflects current issues
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain accurate status indicators in current.md
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide automated documentation testing

#### Infrastructure Requirements
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide automated CI/CD pipeline for testing and releases
- **FR-013**: System MUST include comprehensive test suite with unified test runner
- **FR-014**: System MUST automate releases with semantic versioning
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide code coverage reporting with 80% minimum threshold

#### Developer Experience Requirements
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide interactive onboarding for new users
- **FR-017**: System MUST display progress indicators during long operations
- **FR-018**: System MUST offer rollback mechanism for failed updates
- **FR-019**: System MUST validate prerequisites before installation
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide debug mode with verbose output
- **FR-021**: System MUST offer dry-run option to preview changes
- **FR-022**: System MUST include comprehensive troubleshooting guide

#### 2025 Best Practices Requirements
- **FR-023**: System MUST integrate documentation linting tools
- **FR-024**: System MUST support visual documentation elements using Mermaid format
- **FR-025**: System MUST ensure accessibility compliance for screen readers
- **FR-026**: System MUST provide API documentation generation capability

#### Performance & Scalability Requirements
- **FR-027**: System MUST support concurrent operations where applicable
- **FR-028**: System MUST implement caching for network operations
- **FR-029**: System MUST provide performance metrics and monitoring
- **FR-030**: System MUST handle documentation sets up to 10,000 files efficiently

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Release**: Versioned distribution package with checksums and signatures
- **Documentation**: Markdown files with metadata for drift detection
- **Test Suite**: Collection of automated tests with coverage metrics
- **Configuration**: User preferences and system settings with validation rules

## Notes
This specification addresses the comprehensive review findings from living-docs-review-2025.md, focusing on critical security vulnerabilities, documentation accuracy, missing infrastructure, developer experience gaps, and alignment with 2025 best practices. The requirements are prioritized by criticality, with security and documentation accuracy taking precedence.
