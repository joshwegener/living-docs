**Status**: Implemented
**Created**: 2025-09-20 (retrospectively)
**Type**: Documentation Enhancement

## Problem Statement
Users encountering issues with living-docs installation, updates, or runtime had no comprehensive resource for self-service troubleshooting. This led to increased support burden and user frustration.

## Solution Overview
Created a comprehensive troubleshooting guide (`docs/troubleshooting.md`) covering:
- Common installation issues
- Update problems
- Adapter-specific issues
- Permission errors
- Network/connectivity problems
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Debug mode usage
- Rollback procedures
- Performance optimization

## Implementation Details

### Document Structure (634 lines)
1. **Quick Diagnosis** - Initial diagnostic commands
2. **Installation Issues** - Permission, template, detection problems
3. **Update Problems** - Version mismatches, config breaks
4. **Adapter Issues** - Spec-kit, BMAD, Agent-OS specific
5. **Permission Errors** - System directories, read-only filesystems
6. **Network Problems** - GitHub API limits, firewalls, SSL
7. **Cross-Platform** - macOS vs Linux differences
8. **Debug Mode** - Comprehensive debug usage
9. **Rollback Procedures** - Emergency recovery
10. **Drift Detection** - Documentation consistency
11. **Performance** - Large project optimization
12. **Emergency Recovery** - Complete system recovery

### Key Features
- **Problem-Solution Format**: Each issue has clear symptoms and solutions
- **Code Examples**: Executable commands for each solution
- **Multiple Solutions**: Various approaches for different scenarios
- **Platform-Specific**: Addresses both macOS and Linux quirks
- **Integration**: Links to debug logging system

## Success Metrics
