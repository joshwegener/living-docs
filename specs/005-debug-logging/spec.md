# Spec 005: Debug Logging System (Retrospective)

**Status**: Implemented
**Created**: 2025-09-20 (retrospectively)
**Type**: Infrastructure Enhancement

## Problem Statement
The living-docs system needed comprehensive debug logging capabilities to aid in troubleshooting installation, update, and runtime issues. Without proper logging, users couldn't diagnose problems effectively.

## Solution Overview
Implemented a comprehensive debug logging library (`lib/debug/logger.sh`) that provides:
- Multi-level logging (ERROR, WARN, INFO, TRACE)
- File and console output
- Performance timing
- Context preservation
- Security features (input sanitization, path validation)
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS/Linux)

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
1. **Logger Library** (`lib/debug/logger.sh`)
   - 439 lines of robust bash logging functionality
   - Supports both associative arrays (bash 4+) and fallback for older bash
   - Thread-safe file operations
   - Millisecond precision timing

### Key Features
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `LIVING_DOCS_DEBUG=1` - Enable debug mode
  - `LIVING_DOCS_DEBUG_LEVEL` - Set verbosity (ERROR/WARN/INFO/TRACE)
  - `LIVING_DOCS_DEBUG_FILE` - Log to file

- **Functions**:
  - `debug_log()` - Basic logging
  - `debug_info/warn/error/trace()` - Level-specific logging
  - `debug_context()` - Logs with file:function:line info
  - `debug_vars()` - Variable state dumping
  - `debug_start_section/end_section()` - Nested context tracking
  - `debug_timing_start/end()` - Performance measurement

### Security Considerations
- Path traversal detection for log files
- Input sanitization (null byte removal)
- Secure file permissions (644 for logs, 755 for directories)
- Maximum path length validation

## Testing Requirements (Retrospective)
**Note**: Tests should have been written first per TDD. Creating now for compliance.

Required test coverage:
- [ ] Basic logging functionality
- [ ] Level filtering
- [ ] File output
- [ ] Context preservation
- [ ] Performance timing
- [ ] Security validations
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility

## Success Metrics
- Users can enable debug mode via environment variable
- Debug logs provide sufficient detail for troubleshooting
- No performance impact when debug mode disabled
- Works on both macOS and Linux

## Phase Status
- Phase 0 (Research):  Complete (implicitly)
- Phase 1 (Design):  Complete (retrospectively documented)
- Phase 2 (Tasks):  Complete (retrospectively)
- Phase 3 (Implementation):  Complete
- Phase 4 (Validation): =4 Needs test creation
