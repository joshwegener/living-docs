# Research: Robust Adapter Installation & Management

## Current Adapter System Analysis

### Existing Installation Flow (wizard.sh)
**Decision**: Enhance wizard.sh adapter installation with safety measures
**Rationale**: Current system works but lacks safeguards against conflicts and broken installations
**Alternatives considered**: Complete rewrite (rejected - breaks backward compatibility)

Current flow analysis:
1. Wizard clones adapter repo to adapters/[name]/
2. Runs adapter's install.sh with path variables
3. No manifest tracking of installed files
4. No conflict detection for commands
5. No path validation before installation

### Path Patterns Requiring Rewrite

**Decision**: Use sed-based path rewriting in temporary directory
**Rationale**: sed is universal, allows preview before commit
**Alternatives considered**:
- In-place editing (rejected - risk of partial failure)
- Template engines (rejected - adds dependencies)

Identified patterns in spec-kit v0.0.47:
- `scripts/bash/` → `{{SCRIPTS_PATH}}/bash/`
- `.spec/` → `{{SPECS_PATH}}/`
- `memory/` → `{{MEMORY_PATH}}/`
- `.claude/commands/` → `{{AI_PATH}}/commands/`
- Relative paths in command files need context awareness

### Command Conflict Detection

**Decision**: Prefix-based namespacing with opt-out
**Rationale**: Prevents overwrites while allowing clean names for single-adapter users
**Alternatives considered**:
- Mandatory prefixing (rejected - breaks existing installations)
- Directory namespacing (rejected - complicates AI tool discovery)

Conflict patterns found:
- spec-kit: generic names (plan.md, implement.md, tasks.md)
- BMAD: already prefixed (bmad-plan.md, bmad-implement.md)
- aider: generic names (conventions.md, architect.md)
- cursor: generic names (rules.md)

### Manifest Tracking Design

**Decision**: JSON manifest in adapter directory with file checksums
**Rationale**: Simple, portable, allows change detection
**Alternatives considered**:
- SQLite database (rejected - adds dependency)
- Git submodules (rejected - complex for users)

Manifest structure:
```json
{
  "adapter": "spec-kit",
  "version": "0.0.47",
  "installed": "2025-01-21T10:00:00Z",
  "prefix": "speckit_",
  "files": {
    "path/to/file": {
      "checksum": "sha256:abc123...",
      "customized": false,
      "original_path": "scripts/bash/foo.sh"
    }
  },
  "agents": ["agent1.md", "agent2.md"],
  "commands": ["speckit_plan.md", "speckit_implement.md"]
}
```

### Update Detection Strategy

**Decision**: Compare checksums, preserve customizations
**Rationale**: Respects user modifications while getting upstream fixes
**Alternatives considered**:
- Force overwrites (rejected - loses customizations)
- Never update (rejected - misses bug fixes)

Update algorithm:
1. Fetch upstream version
2. Compare manifest checksums
3. For unchanged files: update directly
4. For customized files: show diff, ask user
5. For new files: add with path rewriting
6. Update manifest with new checksums

## Implementation Recommendations

### Safe Installation Process
1. Clone adapter to `./tmp/adapter-name/`
2. Scan all files for hardcoded paths
3. Create rewrite mappings
4. Apply sed transformations
5. Validate no broken references
6. Move to final location
7. Create manifest
8. Clean up tmp directory

### Path Validation Rules
- No absolute paths allowed (except system commands)
- All project paths must use variables
- Cross-references must be validated
- Scripts must use `$SCRIPTS_PATH` not hardcoded

### Agent Support
- Detect `.claude/agents/`, `.github/copilot-agents/`, etc.
- Install to appropriate AI directory
- Track in manifest for removal
- Validate agent YAML/JSON syntax

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing installations continue working
- Prefixing disabled by default for single adapter
- Migration path for existing users
- Version detection for old adapters

## Risk Mitigation

### Installation Risks
- **Risk**: Partial installation on failure
- **Mitigation**: Atomic move from tmp/ only after validation

### Update Risks
- **Risk**: Breaking customizations
- **Mitigation**: Never overwrite customized files without confirmation

### Removal Risks
- **Risk**: Leaving orphaned files
- **Mitigation**: Manifest tracks every installed file

### Conflict Risks
- **Risk**: Command name collisions
- **Mitigation**: Automatic prefixing with namespace

## Performance Considerations
- Temp directory operations: < 1 second
- Path rewriting via sed: < 2 seconds for 100 files
- Checksum generation: < 1 second for typical adapter
- Total installation time: < 5 seconds target met
