# Feature Specification: Robust Adapter Installation & Management

**Feature Branch**: `007-adapter-installation`
**Created**: 2025-01-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Robust Adapter Installation & Management fix the 7 items listed above"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: adapter installation, management, 7 specific improvements
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: adapters, installation safety, path handling, conflicts, updates
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All items clearly defined from ideas.md context
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flows defined for installation, updates, removal
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Adapters, Commands, Paths, Manifests
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No clarifications needed - all requirements clear
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer using living-docs, I want to install framework adapters (like spec-kit) without worrying about path conflicts, command overwrites, or broken installations, so that I can use multiple frameworks together safely.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a project with existing user commands, **When** installing spec-kit adapter, **Then** adapter commands are prefixed and don't overwrite user files
2. **Given** a project with custom paths (SCRIPTS_PATH=/my/scripts), **When** installing any adapter, **Then** all hardcoded paths are rewritten to use custom paths
3. **Given** an installed adapter with customizations, **When** checking for updates, **Then** system shows what changed upstream and preserves local customizations
4. **Given** multiple installed adapters, **When** removing one adapter, **Then** only that adapter's files are removed completely
5. **Given** an adapter with agent templates, **When** installing to Claude project, **Then** agents are installed to .claude/agents/ directory

### Edge Cases
- What happens when adapter has hardcoded paths that weren't detected?
- How does system handle adapter removal when files were manually modified?
- What happens when two adapters want to install same-named commands?
- How does system handle adapter updates when upstream structure changed significantly?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST prefix adapter commands with adapter name to prevent overwrites (e.g., spec-kit commands become speckit_implement.md)
- **FR-002**: System MUST scan adapters for hardcoded paths before installation and rewrite them to use configured paths
- **FR-003**: System MUST support installing agent templates to AI-specific agent directories (.claude/agents/, etc.)
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide safe installation by cloning to temporary directory, rewriting paths, then moving files
- **FR-005**: System MUST track all installed adapter files in manifest for complete removal
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect upstream adapter changes and show diff while preserving local path customizations
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate path references in adapter files before installation completes
- **FR-008**: System MUST support complete adapter removal that cleans up all tracked files and directories
- **FR-009**: System MUST make command prefixing optional/configurable per adapter
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle adapters that already prefix their own commands (like BMAD)

### Key Entities
- **Adapter**: A framework integration package containing commands, scripts, templates, and optionally agents
- **Command**: AI assistant command file that may conflict with user commands if not prefixed
- **Agent**: AI assistant agent definition that needs special directory placement
- **Manifest**: Record of all files/directories installed by an adapter for tracking and removal
- **Path Reference**: Any hardcoded path in adapter files that needs rewriting for custom installations
