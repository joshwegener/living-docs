# Contributing to living-docs

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues. When you create a bug report, include as many details as possible using the issue template.

### Suggesting Enhancements
Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue and provide:
- A clear and descriptive title
- Step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement
- Specific examples to demonstrate the steps
- Description of the current behavior vs expected behavior
- Explanation of why this enhancement would be useful

### Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code, add tests
3. Ensure your code follows the existing style
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Issue that pull request!

## Development Process

We use our own living-docs system for development:
1. Check `docs/current.md` for current priorities
2. Look at `docs/active/` for work in progress
3. Add ideas to `ideas.md`
4. Report bugs in `bugs.md` first, then GitHub issues for public tracking

## Style Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Shell Script Style
- Use bash (not sh)
- Include error handling
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow existing patterns in wizard.sh

### Documentation Style
- Keep it simple and clear
- Use examples liberally
- Follow the existing structure
- Update `docs/current.md` when adding new docs

## Community
- Be welcoming and inclusive
- Respect differing viewpoints
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what's best for the community
