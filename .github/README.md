# living-docs Project Uses GitHub Spec-Kit

**IMPORTANT**: This `.github/` directory contains OUR team's choice of methodology (GitHub Spec-Kit) for developing living-docs itself.

## This is NOT Required for Your Project!

When you use living-docs, you can choose:
- GitHub Spec-Kit (like we do)
- BMAD Method
- Agent OS
- No methodology at all
- Your own custom approach

## Why We Show This

1. **Transparency**: You can see how we develop living-docs
2. **Real Example**: Shows spec-kit + living-docs working together
3. **Dogfooding**: We use our own framework

## For Your Project

Run `./setup.sh` and choose YOUR preferred methodology. You don't have to use what we use!

*Think of this like seeing React's build setup - interesting but not required for using React.*
